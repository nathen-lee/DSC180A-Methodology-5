## Prompts
1. The most interesting topic I covered this quarter was the neuro data we are working with itself and how it is collected.

2. A potential investigation I would like to pursue next quarter would be the connections between neurons when certain actions are performed.

3. A potential change I would like to have made this on this quarter's project was finding direction and stable footing earlier on.

4. I would be very interested in using the data collection techniques in class or at least observing the data collection process.
